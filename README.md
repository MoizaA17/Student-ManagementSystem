# 🎓 Python Project: Student Management System  
### Console-Based OOP Project

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

Welcome to my **Student Management System**, a console-based Python project developed as part of my **Python-Learning Journey**. 🌱

The goal of this project was to strengthen my Python fundamentals by building something meaningful from scratch. This system allows for **efficient student and course management**, including adding, updating, searching, deleting records, all while storing data persistently using JSON.

This project helped me dive deep into **Object-Oriented Programming**, **file handling**, **modular coding**, and **practical logic-building** , essential skills for anyone aspiring to work in tech or data.

## ✨ Key Features

- ✅ Add New Students (name, roll no, contact, etc.)
- ✅ View All Student Records
- ✅ Search Students by ID
- ✅ Update or Delete Existing Students
- ✅ Enroll/Remove Students in/from Courses
- ✅ Persistent Data Storage via JSON
- ✅ Input Validation and User-Friendly Menu Interface

---


## 🧠 What I Learned

- 💡 Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Composition, Custom Methods)
- 💾 File Handling with JSON: Save/load structured data persistently
- 🔁 Data Conversion: Serializing and deserializing nested objects
- 🧪 Debugging: Solved issues like type errors, missing keys, object conversion
- 🔍 Modular Programming: Code split across clean and logical files
- ✅ Error Handling: Input validation and safe file loading
